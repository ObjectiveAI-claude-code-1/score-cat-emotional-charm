    "spec": "Rank cat pictures by their emotional resonance — the depth and immediacy of feeling each image is likely to provoke in a viewer. Evaluate whether each image triggers a genuine emotional response such as laughter, tenderness, awe, or warmth, and gauge the strength of that response. The specific emotion matters less than its presence and intensity. An image with high emotional resonance bypasses analytical thought and lands immediately — a sharp exhale of laughter, a softening around the eyes, a sudden urge to show it to someone nearby. A technically polished image that provokes nothing should rank lower than an imperfect image that captures something deeply felt. A blurry phone snapshot of a cat doing something unexpectedly tender may rank far above a pristine studio portrait of a cat sitting still. The core question is: does this picture make the viewer feel something genuine, and how powerfully does it do so? Without emotional resonance, a cat picture is just documentation. With it, a cat picture becomes a small gift. When evaluating sub-tasks, focus on the immediacy and depth of emotional impact — not technical quality, not composition, not aesthetic polish — purely the strength of feeling the image provokes.",

    "spec": "Rank cat pictures by their unselfconscious charm — the presence of a natural, unposed moment that feels alive with authentic cat behavior. Evaluate whether each image captures a cat being genuinely itself, without any sense of contrivance or staging. Look for moments of unselfconscious behavior: a kitten curled into an impossibly small ball, a cat caught mid-leap with all four legs splayed in improbable directions, a cat kneading a blanket with half-closed eyes lost in private contentment, a cat startled into an absurd posture. These moments are the beating heart of the best cat pictures because they preserve the qualities that draw humans to cats — their grace, their absurdity, their fierce independence, and their startling capacity for tenderness. The best cat pictures feel like small acts of witnessing rather than staged productions. They say: look, here is this creature doing what it does, and isn't it wonderful that we get to see it. Images that feel contrived, forced, or overly produced should rank lower than those that feel honest and spontaneous. When evaluating sub-tasks, focus on the authenticity and naturalness of the captured moment — whether the cat's behavior feels genuine and unperformed, and whether the image preserves the honest charm that makes cats endlessly fascinating.",

    "spec": "Rank cat pictures by their enduring appeal — the staying power that makes a person want to save an image, share it, or come back to it later. Evaluate whether each image possesses the quality that transforms a fleeting glance into a lasting impression. Some cat pictures are pleasant in the moment and immediately forgotten. Others lodge themselves in memory — you think of them days later, scroll back to find them, send them to a friend with no context because the image speaks for itself. Enduring appeal is closely tied to universality: images that score highest here tap into broadly shared experiences and emotions — the joy of watching a cat discover something new, the comedy of a cat's affronted dignity, the peace of a cat entirely at rest. A picture with enduring appeal captures one of these universal moments so cleanly and fully that it feels definitive rather than disposable. It is not just a picture of a cat being funny — it is the picture of a cat being funny, the one you think of when you think of that feeling. The core question is: will this image last? Will it be the one someone remembers, returns to, and shares? When evaluating sub-tasks, focus on universality and memorability — whether the image taps into the shared human experience of loving cats so effectively that it transcends the moment of first viewing and becomes something worth keeping.",
