1. Evaluate the emotional resonance of each cat image by assessing the depth and immediacy of feeling it is likely to provoke in a viewer. Determine whether the image triggers a genuine emotional response — laughter, tenderness, awe, or warmth — and gauge the strength of that response. A technically polished image that provokes nothing should score lower than an imperfect image that captures something deeply felt. The question this task answers is: does this picture make you feel something, and how powerfully does it do so?

2. Assess the unselfconscious charm of each cat image by examining whether it captures a natural, unposed moment that feels alive with authentic cat behavior. Look for instances of cats being genuinely themselves — a kitten curled into an impossibly small space, a cat mid-leap with legs splayed in absurd directions, a cat kneading a blanket in private contentment. Evaluate whether the moment feels witnessed rather than staged, and whether it preserves the qualities that draw people to cats: their grace, their absurdity, their independence, and their capacity for unexpected tenderness. Images that feel contrived or overly produced should score lower than those that feel honest and spontaneous.

3. Determine the enduring appeal of each cat image by evaluating whether it possesses the staying power that makes a person want to save it, share it, or return to it. Assess whether the image taps into universal experiences and emotions — the joy of a cat discovering something new, the comedy of feline indignation, the peace of a cat entirely at rest — so cleanly that it feels definitive rather than disposable. The question this task answers is: will this image lodge in memory, be the one someone sends to a friend without context, and still feel just as good the second or tenth time it is seen?
